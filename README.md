# Welcome to Propeller!
Here you'll find a collection of documentation regarding available amenities, links to safety testing, and a few starter project ideas to get you going. If anything in this documentation is outdated, please don't hesitate to reach out to staff. We'll do our best to keep this updated!

## Saftey tests
To gain key access to the metal and wood shops, you must first pass safety test. Don't sweat it! It's not incredibly difficult. If you have trouble, feel free to ask for help. We just want to encourage you to think critically about safety!

## Communication on Equipment Status
If for any reason you find or leave a piece of equipment inoperable, please communicate this with staff. The more we know about downed equipment, the faster we can get it working again. If no one is around, at the very least, please leave a note.
